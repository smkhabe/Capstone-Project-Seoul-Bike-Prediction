# Capstone-Project-Seoul-Bike-Prediction

Project Title : Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

Problem Description
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.


Conclusion

No overfitting is seen.

Random forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting gridsearchcv gives the highest R2 score of 99% and 95% recpectively for Train Set and 92% for Test set.

Feature Importance value for Random Forest and Gradient Boost are different.

We can deploy this model.

However, this is not the ultimate end. As this data is time dependent, the values for variables like temperature, windspeed, solar radiation etc., will not always be consistent. Therefore, there will be scenarios where the model might not perform well. As Machine learning is an exponentially evolving field, we will have to be prepared for all contingencies and also keep checking our model from time to time. Therefore, having a quality knowledge and keeping pace with the ever evolving ML field would surely help one to stay a step ahead in future.
